                <p>Reading is easier, too, in the new Reading view. You can collapse parts of the document and focus on
                    the text you want. If you need to stop reading before you reach the end, Word remembers where you
                    left off - even on another device.

                    and sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from the different galleries.</p>
